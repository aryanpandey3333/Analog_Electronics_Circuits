# Analog_Electronics_Circuits
This repository contains my lab files for Analog Electronics circuits. The files include circuit diagrams, schematics, and simulation results that were created as part of my coursework.

Each lab file corresponds to a specific Analog Electronics circuit, and includes a brief description of the circuit's function, design, and analysis. The files are organized by lab session and cover a range of topics, including amplifiers, filters, and oscillators.

Overall, these lab files provide a comprehensive introduction to Analog Electronics and demonstrate its use in practical applications. They are suitable for students and hobbyists interested in analog circuit design and analysis.
